            <p class="aboutme">Programming (and gaming) has always been a huge part of my life, ever since I was about the age of 11. Back then, I played on a website called ROBLOX, which became my first introduction to programming. The idea of coding the scripts behind the scenes to make things work enthralled me, and it still does to this day. Throughout my middle school and high school years, I kept practicing programming, with encouragement from my family. College really was the big step though. I went to Full Sail University and took their Game Development program, and this is where I confirmed programming was for me. After graduating with a Bachelors in Game Development, I came back to Full Sail to take part in their Simulation and Visualization program. I'm currently in my final month of that degree, and have loved this program too. Getting to experience Virtual Reality development was an amazing experience to add on to my already incredible experience from my Game Dev degree.</p>
